# playingcards_probabilities
Various probabilities of situations with playing cards of a 52 card deck.


playingcards.py:

Two cards are randomly chosen without replacement from an ordinary deck of 52 cards. This program stimulates the probabilities of...  

1.Both cards chosen are queens given Queen of Spades is chosen. 
2.Both cards are queens given at least one Queen is chosen.


montecarlo_estimation.py:

Using Monte-Carlo simulations, this program estimates the answer to...

A bit string of length n is generated randomly, where the value of each bit in the string 
is independent of the values of all the other bits. Moreover, each bit takes the value 1 
with probability 0.2 (and 0 otherwise).
Determine the probability that there is at least one 1 in the string (the length of the string is n).
